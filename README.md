# 🚗 Vehicle Speed Detection for Automotive

## 📌 Overview
The Vehicle Speed Detection for Automotive project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and track vehicles in real time. By analyzing video frames, the system estimates vehicle speeds accurately.

## 🎯 Week 2 Milestone
- Integrated object detection (YOLO/SSD/OpenCV-based)
- Implemented frame-by-frame positional speed estimation
- Improved accuracy and performance of detection
- Enhanced README with project overview and structure
- Organized code files and added comments for clarity

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- NumPy / Pandas  
- Matplotlib

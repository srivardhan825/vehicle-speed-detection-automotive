## 🚗 Project Overview

Car Object Detection for Automotive is a computer vision project designed to detect and classify vehicles in real time using deep learning. The main objective of this project is to enhance driver assistance systems and contribute to the development of autonomous driving technologies.

The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and state-of-the-art **object detection models** such as **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** or **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)** to accurately identify vehicles like cars, buses, and trucks from live video streams or recorded footage.

By applying advanced computer vision techniques, this project aims to:
- Improve vehicle detection accuracy under various lighting and weather conditions.
- Enable faster decision-making for driver assistance and automation.
- Provide a framework that can be integrated into real-world automotive applications such as **traffic monitoring**, **collision avoidance**, and **lane assistance systems**.

The repository includes code for model training, evaluation, and inference, along with datasets and configuration files for easy experimentation and deployment.

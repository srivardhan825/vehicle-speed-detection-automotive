🚗 Overview

The Vehicle Speed Detection for Automotive project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and track vehicles in real time. By analyzing frames from a video feed, the system estimates the speed of moving vehicles accurately.

This project is designed for use in traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and driver assistance systems, helping improve road safety and automate speed regulation. It can process live video streams or recorded footage, detect vehicles using an object detection model (such as YOLO, SSD, or OpenCV-based detection), and calculate their speed using frame-by-frame positional analysis.
